                     +--------------------------+


The questions in this design document should reflect the design of the code you
wrote for the project.  Your grade will reflect both the quality of your answer
in this document and the quality of the design implementation in your code.  You
may receive partial credit for answering questions for parts of the project that
you did not get to implement, but you must indicate in your answer that there is
no corresponding implementation, or you will not receive any credit.


For each question, you should include both the name of the file(s), function
name(s), and the line numbers where the relevant code may be found.


These design documents should be completed individually.  Group members are
welcome to use this document as a guide for design and are welcome to discuss
the questions, but there should be no group notes or other sorts of copying of
design documents.


When you have completed your design document, submit it to the Canvas assignment
Project 2 Design and Documentation.  ***Your submission must be a text file and
each line must not extend past 80 characters.  (Note that rtf files are NOT text
files.)


Please note that for Project 2 only, this design document will not be directly
graded.  We instead will use it to guide our questions for your design
interview, and that interview, along with a review of your code will determine
your grade.  Please watch Piazza for more information.
